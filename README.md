# Tile Placement Problem

This project aims to solve the tile placement problem using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques. In the tile placement problem, a player is given a set of tiles with different colors and shapes, and the goal is to place these tiles on a grid such that the grid satisfies certain constraints. The constraints typically include the number of tiles of each color that should be placed, and the number of cells that should be left empty.
